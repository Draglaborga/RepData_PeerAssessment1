## Loading and preprocessing the data


```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
data <- fread("activity.csv", header = T)
print(head(data))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
steps_per_date <- data %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(steps=sum(steps, na.rm=T))
print(head(steps_per_date))
```

2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(steps_per_date$steps)
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
print(paste("Mean of steps per day:", mean(steps_per_date$steps)))
print(paste("Median of steps per day:", median(steps_per_date$steps)))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
